    ```
    $ brew update && brew cask install react-native-debugger
    ```
2.  Open React Native Debugger you just download and press `command+T` to type the port `19001`.
3.  Press `command+D` on your simulator and click `Debug remote JS`, the React Native Debugger will connect to your app.
4.  Note: Must do step 2 before step 3, since the React Native Debugger using `19001` as the port is same as the default of `Debug remote JS` use on browser. If click the `Debug remote JS` first, the error will show you two debugger exiting on the same time.
